Glycerine Enema is used to treat constipation, a common disease easily occurs when people have more fish and meat and less vegetables, fruits and coarse grains in their diets and exercise less. The sales of this medicine stay high in western countries. Its top ranking in China’s medicine market indicates significant improvement of Chinese people’s living standards from another perspective. However, constipation can be avoided by lowering down your living standards appropriately and eating more cereals. In addition, Glycerine Enema is also a good lotion to moisture dry skins, which explains why its sales take the lead in the relatively dry season of spring.

								Dingdang medicine finds that different natural environment and humanity factors between north and south China lead to significant difference in meditation selections. Jintoo 3D protection mask is seen in north China’s top 10 list, while in south China’s list, there is no mask at all. It is obvious that air quality in the north is worse than that of south. Two health care products are listed in south China’s list, namely By-health calcium softgems and Renhe oral solution for nourishing blood and benefiting vital energy, while health care products are absent in north China’s list, which means people in the south stress more about their health care than people in the north.
